This repo contains the plugin "Module d'Export", writted during my working in the Conservatoire D'Espaces Naturels de Picardie.(CEN Pic)

This Qgis plugin aims to export data from de database of the CEN Pic to another format, with a Geographic and attribute filter.

Postgis is used to make the calculus, and PyQt is used to show a GUI and get attributes.

========================================================================================================================================

This plugin was originally designed for a Windows environnement, but I think I'll work on a Linux version.

Also, the plugin is verry specific for the needs of the CEN Pic, so a lot of works has to be make in order to adapt the plugin to another company. 

========================================================================================================================================

This is my first plugin and I'm beginner in Python, so, a lot of improvements may be done..

========================================================================================================================================

IDEAS OF WHAT CAN BE DONE:
 - Improve the code
 - Adapt the plugin to other structures or other CEN.
